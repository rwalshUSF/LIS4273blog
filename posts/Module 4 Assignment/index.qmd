An exercise in probability!

```{r}
table1<-data.frame("B"=c(10,20,30),"B1"=c(20,40,60),"Totals"=c(30,60,90),
row.names = c("A","A1","Totals"))
library(gridExtra)
grid.table(table1)
#Question A.
#Based on Table 1, what is the probability of:
#A1. Event A ?
A<-30/90
paste("The probability of event A = ",format(round(A,4)),"%")
#A2. Event B ?
B<-30/90
paste("The probability of event B = ",format(round(B,4)),"%")
#A3. Event A or B ?
AorB<-((30/90)+(30/90))-(10/90)
paste("The probability of event A or B = ",format(round(AorB,4)),"%")
#A4. P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
AorB == A + B
# Question B.
# In terms of probabilities, we know the following:
# P( A1 ) = 5/365 =0.0136985 [It rains 5 days out of the year.]
# P( A2 ) = 360/365 = 0.9863014 [It does not rain 360 days out of the year.]
# P( B | A1 ) = 0.9 [When it rains, the weatherman predicts rain 90% of the time.]
# P( B | A2 ) = 0.1 [When it does not rain, the weatherman predicts rain 10% of the time.]
# We want to know P( A1 | B ), the probability it will rain on the day of Jane's wedding,
# given a forecast for rain by the weatherman. 

# The answer can be determined from Bayes' theorem, as shown below.

# P( A1 | B ) = P( A1 ) P( B | A1 ) / P( A1 ) P( B | A1 ) + P( A2 ) P( B | A2 )
# P( A1 | B ) = (0.014)(0.9) / [ (0.014)(0.9) + (0.986)(0.1) ]
# P( A1 | B ) = 0.111
# Note the somewhat unintuitive result. Even when the weatherman predicts rain,
# it only rains only about 11% of the time. 
# Despite the weatherman's gloomy prediction, there is a good chance that Jane
# will not get rained on at her wedding.

# Please answer the following questions:
# B1. Is this answer True or False ?
print("TRUE")
# B2. Please explain why:
cat("Bayes' Theorem takes into account your initial belief about the event
(like the usual chance of rain for the day) before new information is considered. 
Even though the weatherman correctly predicts rain 90% of the time..
The base probability of rain is already low, 5/365 = 1.36%.
Even if the weatherman predicts rain,
the new information isn't strong enough to significantly update the probability
high enough to consider it a \"high chance\" of rain.
The \"likelihood ratio\" is not large enough
to drastically change the initial low probability of rain.")
# Question C.
# Last assignment from our textbook, pp. 55 Exercise # 2.3.
# For a disease known to have a postoperative complication frequency of 20%,
# a surgeon suggests a new procedure. She/he tests it on 10 patients and found
# there are not complications.

# C1.You will answer this question with the following code.
# What is the probability of operating on 10 patients successfully
# with the traditional method?
paste("The probability is:",dbinom(x=0,size=10,prob=.20),"%")
