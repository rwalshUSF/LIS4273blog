# LIS4273 - Module 7. Assignment

# Question A.

# In this assignment's segment, we will use the following regression
# equation  Y = a + bX +e

# Y is the value of the dependent variable (Y),
# what is being predicted or explained

# a or Alpha, a constant; equals the value of Y when the value of X=0

# b or Beta, the coefficient of X; the slope of the regression line;
# how much Y changes for each one-unit change in X.

# X is the value of the Independent variable (X),
# what is predicting or explaining the value of Y

# e is the error term; the error in predicting the value of Y,
# given the value of X (it is not displayed in most regression equations).

# The data in this assignment:
x <- c(16, 17, 13, 18, 12, 14, 19, 11, 11, 10)
y <- c(63, 81, 56, 91, 47, 57, 76, 72, 62, 48)

# A1. Define the relationship model between the independent
# and the dependent variable.

# 'x' is the value of the Independent variable (X),
# what is predicting or explaining the value of 'y'.
# 'y' is the value of the dependent variable (Y),
# what is being predicted or explained.

# To model the relationship between how one variable affects the other:
model.x.y<-lm(y~x,)
# Create 'model.x.y' object to store results of.....
# lm(Y~X), linear model: 'y' is predicted by 'x'

# A2. Calculate the coefficients:
# Print 'model.x.y' object.
model.x.y

# Question B.

# The following question is posted by Chi Yau (Links to an external site.)
# the author of  R Tutorial With Bayesian Statistics Using Stan
# (Links to an external site.) and his blog posting regarding
# Regression analysis (Links to an external site.).

# Apply the simple linear regression model (see the above formula)
# for the data set called "visit" (see below), and estimate the
# discharge duration if the waiting time since the last eruption
# has been 80 minutes.

#  >head(visit) 
#  discharge  waiting 
# 1     3.600      79 
# 2     1.800      54 
# 3     3.333      74 
# 4     2.283      62 
# 5     4.533      85 
# 6     2.883      55

visit<-data.frame("discharge"=c(3.600,1.800,3.333,2.283,4.533,2.883),
                  "waiting"=c(79,54,74,62,85,55))

# Employ the following formula lm(discharge~waiting,data=visit)

# B1. Define the relationship model between the predictor
# and the response variable.

# The 'predictor' variable predicts the 'response' variable.
# 'waiting' is the value of the Independent variable (X),
# what is predicting or explaining the value of 'discharge'.
# 'discharge' is the value of the dependent variable (Y),
# what is being predicted or explained.

# To model the relationship between how one variable affects the other:
discharge.lm<-lm(discharge~waiting,data=visit)
# Create 'discharge.lm' object to store results of.....
# lm(discharge~waiting,data=visit), linear model:
# 'discharge' is predicted by 'waiting'

# B2. Extract the parameters of the estimated regression equation
# with the coefficients function.
coeffs<-coefficients(discharge.lm)
coeffs

# B3. Determine the fit of the eruption duration using
# the estimated regression equation.

# Create 'waitingTime' object and initialize to value of '80'.
waitingTime<-80
# Fit the discharge duration using the estimated regression equation.
dischargeDuration<-coeffs[1]+coeffs[2]*waitingTime
dischargeDuration
# Based on the linear regression model, if the waiting time since the
# last discharge has been 80 minutes, we expect the next discharge duration
# to last approximately 3.871431 minutes.

# Question C.  Multiple regression

# We will use a very famous datasets in R called mtcars. This dateset
# was extracted from the 1974 Motor Trend US magazine, and comprises
# fuel consumption and 10 aspects of automobile design and performance
# for 32 automobiles (1973--74 models).

# This data frame contain 32 observations on 11 (numeric) variables.

# [, 1]	mpg	Miles/(US) gallon
# [, 2]	cyl	Number of cylinders
# [, 3]	disp	Displacement (cu.in.)
# [, 4]	hp	Gross horsepower
# [, 5]	drat	Rear axle ratio
# [, 6]	wt	Weight (1000 lbs)
# [, 7]	qsec	1/4 mile time
# [, 8]	vs	Engine (0 = V-shaped, 1 = straight)
# [, 9]	am	Transmission (0 = automatic, 1 = manual)
# [,10]	gear	Number of forward gears

# To call mtcars data in R
# R comes with several built-in data sets, which are generally used
# as demo data for playing with R functions. One of those datasets
# build in R is mtcars.

# In this question, we will use 4 of the variables found in mtcars
# by using the following function
# input <- mtcars[,c("mpg","disp","hp","wt")]

# C1. Examine the relationship Multi Regression Model as stated above
# and its Coefficients using 4 different variables from mtcars
# (mpg, disp, hp and wt).
# Report on the result and explanation what does the multi regression
# model and coefficients tell about the data.
input <- mtcars[,c("mpg","disp","hp","wt")]
print(head(input))
lm(formula=mpg~disp+hp+wt,data=input)
cat("The relationship multi regression model demonstrates that 'mpg' is 
the 'response variable' being predicted by 'disp', 'hp', and 'wt' which
are the 'predictor variables.' What is learned from the coefficients is that
'disp' and 'hp' have coefficients close to 0 which means that they may relate
in similar ways. The -3.8 coefficient for 'wt' means that as 'wt' increases,
'mpg' decreases and as 'mpg' increases, 'wt' decreases. This demonstrates how
each variable predicts or affects 'mpg' differently and to what magnitude. Each
predictor variable is individually related to the response variable.")
