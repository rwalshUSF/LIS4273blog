An exercise in Hypothesis Testing & Correlation!

```{r}
# Question A.

# The director of manufacturing at a cookies company needs to determine
# whether a new machine is able to produce a particular type of cookies
# according to the manufacturer's specifications, which indicate that
# cookies should have a mean of 70 and standard deviation of 3.5 pounds.
# A sample of 49 cookies reveals a sample mean breaking strength
# of 69.1 pounds.

# A1. State the null and alternative hypothesis :

# Null Hypothesis - Ho: The mean µ = 70
# New machine is able to produce cookies within spec.
# Mean breaking strength is equal to 70

# Alt Hypothesis - Ha: The mean µ ≠ 70
# New machine is not able to produce cookies within spec.
# Mean breaking strength is not equal to 70

# A2. Is there evidence that the machine is not meeting the manufacturer's
# specifications for average strength?

# Use a 0.05 level of significance.
alpha <- 0.05
# Population Mean = 70
a <- 70
# Standard Deviation = 3.5
s <- 3.5
# Sample Size = 49
n <- 49
# Sample Mean = 69.1
xbar <- 69.1
# Calculate Test Statistic:
z <- (xbar-a)/(s/sqrt(n))
z
# Use qnorm() to determine critical values @ 0.05 alpha
# Two tailed test would identify a 0.025 rejection area on each tail
z.half.alpha <- qnorm(1-alpha/2)
# The critical vales are - 1.96 and + 1.96
z.half.alpha
-z.half.alpha
# Determine if the Test Statistic is in the rejection region.
z < -z.half.alpha || abs(z) > z.half.alpha
# -1.96 > -1.80 > 0 < 1.80 < 1.96
# The Test Statistic falls between the critical values in the
# 'do not reject Ho/Null' region. Therefore we can infer
# that there is evidence that the machine is meeting the manufacturer’s 
# specifications for average strength.

# A3. Compute the p value and interpret its meaning.

# Use pnorm() to calculate the p value using the Test Statistic 'Z'
# Then multiply the value by two for the two tailed test.
p <- 2*pnorm(z)
# We get a p value of:
p
# Test to see if this p value is greater than alpha.
p > alpha
# Because the p value is greater than alpha, there is not enough
# evidence to reject the Null hypothesis - Ho.

# A4. What would be your answer in (A2) if the standard
# deviation were specified as 1.75 pounds?

alpha <- 0.05
# Population Mean = 70
a <- 70
# Standard Deviation = 1.75
s <- 1.75
# Sample Size = 49
n <- 49
# Sample Mean = 69.1
xbar <- 69.1
# Calculate Test Statistic:
z <- (xbar-a)/(s/sqrt(n))
z
# Use qnorm() to determine critical values @ 0.05 alpha
# Two tailed test would identify a 0.025 rejection area on each tail
z.half.alpha <- qnorm(1-alpha/2)
# The critical vales are - 1.96 and + 1.96
z.half.alpha
-z.half.alpha
# Determine if the Test Statistic is in the rejection region.
z < -z.half.alpha || abs(z) > z.half.alpha
# -3.60 > -1.96 > 0 < 1.96 < 3.60
# The Test Statistic falls outside the critical values in the
# 'reject Ho/Null' region. Therefore we can infer
# that there is evidence that the machine is not meeting the 
# manufacturer’s specifications for average strength.

# A5. What would be your answer in (A2) if the sample mean were 
# 69 pounds and the standard deviation is 3.5 pounds?

alpha <- 0.05
# Population Mean = 70
a <- 70
# Standard Deviation = 3.5
s <- 3.5
# Sample Size = 49
n <- 49
# Sample Mean = 69
xbar <- 69
# Calculate Test Statistic:
z <- (xbar-a)/(s/sqrt(n))
z
# Use qnorm() to determine critical values @ 0.05 alpha
# Two tailed test would identify a 0.025 rejection area on each tail
z.half.alpha <- qnorm(1-alpha/2)
# The critical vales are - 1.96 and + 1.96
z.half.alpha
-z.half.alpha
# Determine if the Test Statistic is in the rejection region.
z < -z.half.alpha || abs(z) > z.half.alpha
# -2 > -1.96 > 0 < 1.96 < 2
# The Test Statistic falls outside the critical values in the
# 'reject Ho/Null' region. Therefore we can infer
# that there is evidence that the machine is not meeting the 
# manufacturer’s specifications for average strength.
```

```{r}
# Question B. If x̅ = 85, σ = standard deviation = 8, and n=64,
# set up 95% confidence interval estimate of the population mean μ.

# The 'Zc' Critical Value for a 95% Level of Confidence C = 1.96
zc <- 1.96
# Sample Mean = 85
xbar <- 85
# Standard Deviation = 8
s <- 8
# Sample Size = 64
n <- 64

# Calculate Upper Confidence Limit value
xBarPlusE <- xbar + (zc*(s/sqrt(n)))
# Calculate Upper Confidence Limit value
xBarMinusE <- xbar - (zc*(s/sqrt(n)))
# Therefore the 95% confidence interval would be:
print("(83.04,86.96)")
# There is a 95% probability that the population mean
# would be in between these two values.
```

```{r}
# Question C. Given the time spent on assignments each week
# for the sampled girl group and boy group, respectively,
library(GGally)
girls_grades <- c(89, 90, 91, 95, 98, 99, 96, 99)
girls_time_spend <- c(19, 20, 22, 25, 28, 30, 32, 36)

boys_grades <- c(86, 84, 92, 93, 93, 96, 98, 98)
boys_time_spend <- c(15, 19, 22, 23, 25, 29, 30, 40)

# Please perform the correlation analysis:

# C1. Calculate the correlation coefficient (Pearson) between
# time spent and grade for girls' and boys' datasets, respectively.

# The Pearson correlation coefficient between time spent and grade
# for the Girls' dataset:
x<-c(girls_grades)
y<-c(girls_time_spend)
girlsData<-data.frame(x,y)
round(cor(girlsData,method="pearson"),digits=2)
# This result is close to 1 so a strong positive relation is implied.

# The Pearson correlation coefficient between time spent and grade
# for the Boys' dataset:
x<-c(boys_grades)
y<-c(boys_time_spend)
boysData<-data.frame(x,y)
round(cor(boysData,method="pearson"),digits=2)
# This result is close to 1 so a strong positive relation is implied.

# C2. Use ggpairs to plot the time spent and grade for
# girls' and boys' datasets, respectively.

# For the Girls' dataset:
ggpairs(
  girlsData,
  upper = list(wrap("cor", size = 5)),
  diag = list(continuous = "densityDiag"),
)
# For the Boys' dataset:
ggpairs(
  boysData,
  upper = list(wrap("cor", size = 5)), 
  diag = list(continuous = "densityDiag"),
)
