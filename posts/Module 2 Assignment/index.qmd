This Function Calculates The Mean!

Here is how it works!

```{r}
# LIS4273 - Module 2. Assignment
# Robert Walsh
# Professor Lingyao Li

# Create a vector using the c() function
# and store the results in the 'assignment2' variable/object

assignment2 <- c(6,18,14,22,27,17,22,20,22)

# Create a function named 'myMean' that will
# accept 'assignment2' as an input variable/argument and then
# calculate & return the value of the sum of all values in the
# 'assignment2' vector using the sum() function, and then divide
# that result by the number of components in the 'assignment2'
# vector using the length() function. the result is stored in the
# 'result' variable/object.

myMean <- function(assignment2) 
{
  return(sum(assignment2)/length(assignment2))
}

# print the result as output by calling 'myMean' with 
# 'assignment2' as the argument

result <- myMean(assignment2)
result

# Here is the output!
```
