# Question A.

# Set up an additive model for the ashina data, as part of ISwR package
library(ISwR)
data("ashina")
attach(ashina)
# This data contain additive effects on subjects, period and treatment.
# Compare the results with those obtained from t tests. 
head(ashina,5)
# Create a new 'ashina$subject' column as a factor w/ values 1-16
ashina$subject<-factor(1:16)
head(ashina,5)
summary(ashina)
# Create two data frames:

# 'act' Given active substance & 'plac' given Placebo
# Include a 'vas' column for the 'vas' summary score value,
# a 'subject' column for the factored numeric subject count,
# a 'treat' column (1 for 'active' & 0 for 'placebo')
# to distinguish between treatment in binary format,
# and a 'period' column to identify the group number from 'ashina$grp'
# where '1' got placebo first & '2' got active first.

attach(ashina)
act<-data.frame(vas=vas.active,subject,treat=1,period=grp)
plac<-data.frame(vas=vas.plac,subject,treat=0,period=grp)

# In order to fit an additive model, the 'act' & 'plac' data.frames must be
# combined together using the rbind() function and the binary values
# converted to factors as well as the subject count.

combinedData<-rbind(act,plac)

# Now the data frame can be modeled to compare the predictor variables 
# to the response variable to see if there is a significant statistical
# difference to 'var' values from the additive effects of:
# 'subject'+'period'+'treat'

addModel<-lm(vas~subject+period+treat,data=combinedData)
summary(addModel)
# The results show that with an F-statistic of 2.914 and a 
# p-value of 0.02229, the model is significant.
# For the increase from 0-1 in 'treat', 'vas' decreased by 42.87

# Perform t tests

tTest1<-t.test(vas~treat,data=combinedData)
tTest1
# When testing to determine if 'treat' affects 'vas'
# The t test results state that the t-statistic is 2.4699
# with 24.063 degrees of freedom. Because the p-value 0.02099 is less than
# alpha 0.05 the null hypothesis would be rejected.This concludes that both
# treatments have a significant effect on the 'vas' scores with the active
# treatment group showing lower mean 'vas' score compared to the placebo group.
# The p-value is similar to the p-value from the model summary which
# indicated that 'treat' was statistically significant.

tTest2<-t.test(vas~period,data=combinedData)
tTest2
# When testing to determine if 'period' affects 'vas'
# The t test results state that the t-statistic is -1.8995
# with 29.872 degree if freedom. Because the p-value 0.0672 is greater than
# alpha 0.05 we fail to reject the null. There is not enough evidence to
# conclude that the 'period' significantly affected the mean 'vas' scores. 

# Question B

# Consider the following
a<-gl(2,2,8) # Creates factor with 2 levels,each repeated 2 times,length 8
b<-gl(2,4,8) # Creates factor with 2 levels,each repeated 4 times,length 8
x<-1:8
y<-c(1:4,8:5)
z<-rnorm(8)

# Instruction: The rnorm() is a built-in R function that generates a vector
# of normally distributed random numbers. The rnorm() method takes a sample
# size as input and generates that many random numbers. We are looking for
# two models: (1) model.matrix (~a:b); (2) lm (z~a:b)

# B1. Your assignment is to generate the model matrices for the following models

# z ~ a*b  # Model with interaction (a*b)

mm1<-model.matrix(~a*b)
mm1
fmm1<-lm(z~a*b)
summary(fmm1)
# z ~ a:b  # Model with only interaction term (a:b)

mm2<-model.matrix(~a:b)
mm2
fmm2<-lm(z~a:b)
summary(fmm2)
# B2. Please also discuss the implications of using these two models;
# please be reminded about the model fits and notice
# which models contain singularities.

# Interaction Model Matrix
mm1
# This design matrix will include columns for the main effects of a and b,
# as well as their interaction term (a:b).

# Interaction-term-Only Model Matrix
mm2
# This design matrix will only include the interaction term (a:b),
# without main effects. 

# Interaction Model Fit
summary(fmm1)
# This model will estimate the effects of a, b,
# and their interaction on the response variable z

# Interaction-term-Only Model Fit
summary(fmm2)
# This model will estimate the effect of the interaction term a:b on z,
# assuming no separate effects for a or b.
# A singularity occurs here, probably because the main effects of a and b 
# are highly correlated with the interaction term, and it doesn't account 
# for the separate effects.

# Both models have the same R-squared value, 0.4907, indicating similar
# explanatory power. However, the significance levels of the coefficients
# differ between the two models. In the interaction model, you can assess 
# the significance of the main effects and the interaction term separately.
# In the interaction-term-only model, you can only assess the significance of 
# the interaction term.
