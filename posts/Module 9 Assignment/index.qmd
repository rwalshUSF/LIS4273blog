An Exercise in tabular data!

# Question A.

# Your data.frame is listed as below.

df <- data.frame(
  country = c("France", "Spain", "Germany", "Spain", "Germany", "France",
              "Spain", "France", "Germany", "France"),
  age = c(44, 27, 30, 38, 40, 35, 52, 48, 45, 37),
  salary = c(6000, 5000, 7000, 4000, 8000, 6000, 5000, 7000, 4000, 8000),
  purchased = c("No", "Yes", "No", "No", "Yes", "Yes", "No",
                "Yes", "No", "Yes")
)
# Please do the following:

# A1. Generate a one-way table for "purchased"
oneWayPurchased<-table(df$purchased)
oneWayPurchased
# A2. Generate a two-way table for "country" and "purchased."
twoWayCountryPurchased<-table(df$country,df$purchased)
twoWayCountryPurchased

# Question B.

# Generate contingency table also known as rx C table using mtcars dataset. 
data(mtcars)
mtcars_df <- table(mtcars$gear, mtcars$cyl, dnn = c("Gears", "Cylinders"))
mtcars_df
# B1. Add the addmargins() function to report on the sum totals of the
#     rows and columns of "mtcars_df" table
addmargins(mtcars_df)
# addmargins() function:
# Displays the margins of the table, or the sum of each row and/or column
# to help understand differences among factors.
# There are more three gear cars than four or five gear cars and more eight
# cylinder cars than four or six cylinder cars.

# B2. Add prop.tables() function, and report on the proportional weight
#     of each value in the "mtcars_df" table
prop.table(mtcars_df)
# prop.table() function:
# Displays a table of proportions rather than sums. The default argument for
# 'margin=', the sum of all cells in the table will equal 1.
# Therefore the largest proportion of cars have eight cylinders and 
# three gears, 37.5%, and 0% of the cars have eight cylinders and four gears.
