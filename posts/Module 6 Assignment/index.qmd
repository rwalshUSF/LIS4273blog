# Question A.

# Consider a population consisting of the following values,
# which represents the number of ice cream purchases during
# one year for each of the five housemates.

# 8, 14, 16, 10, 11.
numPurchases<-c(8,14,16,10,11)
# A1. Compute the mean of this population.
popMean<-mean(numPurchases)
popMean
# A2. Select a random sample of size 2 out of the five members.
rSample<-sample(numPurchases,2)
rSample
# A3. Compute the mean and standard deviation of your sample.

# The Mean of the sample:
rSampleMean<-mean(rSample)
rSampleMean
# The standard deviation of the sample:
rSampleStdDev<-sd(rSample)
rSampleStdDev
# A4. Compare the Mean and Standard deviation of your sample
# to the entire population of this set (8,14, 16, 10, 11).

# The standard deviation of the population:
popStdDev<-sd(numPurchases)
popStdDev
df<-data.frame("Population"=c(popMean,popStdDev),
               "Sample"=c(rSampleMean,rSampleStdDev),
               row.names=(c("Mean","Std Dev")))
# The data frame to compare the Mean and Standard deviation of the sample
# to the entire population of this set (8,14, 16, 10, 11).
df
# Question B. 

# Suppose that the sample size n = 100 and
# the population proportion p = 0.95.

# B1. Does the sample proportion p have approximately
# a normal distribution? Explain.
cat("The distribution is considered normal if both :
      n*p >= 5, and
      n*q >= 5.
      n = 100
      p = 0.95 and 
      q = 0.05.
      
      Therefore,
      n*p = 100*0.95 = 95 >= 5 and
      n*q = 100*0.05 = 5 >= 5.
      
      The sample proportion 'p' will have approximately
      a normal distribution to be normal with these values.")
# B2. What is the smallest value of n for which the
# sampling distribution of p is approximately normal?
cat("The smallest value of 'n' for which the sampling distribution
      of 'p' is approximately normal is 100.
      
      Any value less than 100, when multiplied with p = 0.95
      and q = 0.05 will make n*q <= 5,
      and both n*p and n*q need to be >= 5
      in order to assume a normal distribution.")
# Question C.
# From our textbook, Chapter 2 Probability Exercises # 2.4.
# Simulated coin tossing is probability better done using
# function called 'rbinom()' than using the function called 'sample()'.

# C1. Please explain the reason why 'rbinom()' is better
# than 'sample()' in the coin tossing simulation.
cat("The reason why the 'rbinom()' function is better
      than the 'sample()' function in the coin tossing
      simulation is that the 'sample()' function would need to
      create a vector with 'Char' type elements like \"H\"
      & \"T\", then set 'replace=TRUE', & set'prob=c(0.5,0.5)'.
      That would require extra programming instructions
      in order to simulate random sampling from that vector.
      This could affect the outcomes / experiment results. 
      This extra step can be avoided by using 'rbinom()'
      because it is designed to extract random sample outcomes from
      the binomial distribution. This makes 'rbinom()' the better
      choice because it is more efficient and readable as the code 
      clearly indicates that a binomial event, like a coin toss, is 
      being simulated."
