# Question A.

# Conduct ANOVA (analysis of variance) and Regression coefficients to 
# the data from data (" cystfibr ") database. You can choose any variable 
# you like to interpret.
library(ISwR)
data("cystfibr")
attach(cystfibr)

#-------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# A1. In the report, please state the result of coefficients and 
# significance to any variables you like both under ANOVA and multivariate 
# analysis. Please provide a specific interpretation of R results.

# model:
# 'bmp' as a function of 'age'+'height'+'weight'+'rv'+'frc'+'tlc'+'pemax'
bmpModelOne<-lm(bmp~age+height+weight+rv+frc+tlc+pemax,data=cystfibr)
# The Coefficients:
bmpModelOne
# The intercept is 138.94756 
# Therefore, the estimated body mass percentage of normal would be
# around 139 if all predictor variables were 0.

# age: indicates that for each increment of 1 in age, a person’s 'bmp' 
# decreases by 2.34798 with all other variables constant.

# height: indicates that for each increment of 1 in height, a person’s 'bmp' 
# decreases by 0.34820 with all other variables constant.

# weight: indicates that for each increment of 1 in weight, a person’s 'bmp' 
# increases by 1.42015 with all other variables constant.

# Summary of the regression model to seek significant relationships
# among the variables:
summary(bmpModelOne)
# This analysis suggests that 'age', 'height', and 'weight' are significant
# to 'bmp', and that 'rv', 'frc', 'tlc', and 'pemax' could be removed from
# the model without significantly affecting the dependent variable outcomes &
# the F-statistic of 17.36 with a p-value of 1.357e-06 suggests that at least
# one predictor variable is significantly related to the response variable.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#
# ANOVA of the regression model to seek significant relationships
# among the variables:
anova(bmpModelOne)
# This analysis suggests that 'age','height','weight','rv', and 'tlc' are 
# significant to 'bmp' and 'frc' & 'pemax' could be removed from
# the model without significantly affecting the dependent variable outcomes.
# The ANOVA table indicates that there is no significant improvement of the
# model once 'age','height','weight','rv', and 'tlc' are included.

# Perform a joint test to determine if 'frc' & 'pemax' could be removed from
# the model without significantly affecting the dependent variable outcomes.
bmpModelTwo<-lm(bmp~age+height+weight+rv+tlc,data=cystfibr)
anova(bmpModelOne,bmpModelTwo)
# The ANOVA table suggests we can remove 'frc' & 'pemax'.
# The large p-value 0.2017 provides good evidence that 'model 2' with five
# predictors fits as well as 'model 1' with seven predictors.

#---------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Dropping 'pemax' from the analysis may result in losing valuable data
# Therefore, a Multivariate Multiple Regression will model multiple dependent
# variables, with a single set of predictor variables.

# model:
# 'bmp' and 'pemax' as a function of 'age'+'height'+'weight'+'rv'+'frc'+'tlc'
mlm1<-lm(cbind(cystfibr$bmp,cystfibr$pemax)~age+height+weight+rv+frc+tlc)
# Summary of the Multivariate Multiple Regression model to seek significant 
# relationships among the variables:
summary(mlm1)
# Is a predictor variable jointly contributing to both models?

# The model for Response 'cystfibr$bmp' suggests that at least one 
# predictor variable is significantly related to the response variable.
# F-statistic:  18.2 & p-value: 9.551e-07
# 'age','height','weight',and 'tlc' are significant

# The model for Response 'cystfibr$pemax' suggests that at least one 
# predictor variable is significantly related to the response variable.
# F-statistic: 3.048 & p-value: 0.03083
# No predictors indicate significance, the p-value: 0.03083 does.

# Determining whether or not to include predictors in a multivariate multiple
# regression requires the use of multivariate test statistics (Ford, 2024)
# The easiest way to do this is to use the Anova() function
# in the car package (Fox and Weisberg, 2011)
library(car)
Anova(mlm1)
# The Type II MANOVA Tests suggest 'height','rv','frc',and 'tlc' are
# jointly insignificant for the two models

# Check to see if a model with just 'age' and 'weight' fits as well as 
# a model with all six predictors.
# Fit a smaller model and then compare the smaller model to the larger
# model using the anova() function (Ford, 2024)
mlm2<-lm(cbind(cystfibr$bmp,cystfibr$pemax)~age+weight)
anova(mlm1,mlm2)
# The large p-value 0.1116 provides good evidence that the model with
# two predictors fits as well as the model with six predictors.


#------------------------------------------------------------------------#

# Question B.

# The secher data("secher") are best analyzed after log-transforming birth
# weight as well as the abdominal and biparietal diameters. Fit a prediction
# weight as well as abdominal and biparietal diameters.
data("secher")
attach(secher)
# Fit linear regression for 'bwt' using the log transformed 'ad'
# Model with only abdominal diameter:
model_ad<-lm(log(bwt)~I(log(ad)),data=secher)
summary(model_ad)
# Fit linear regression for 'bwt' using the log transformed 'bpd'
# Model with only biparietal diameter:
model_bpd<-lm(log(bwt)~I(log(bpd)),data=secher)
summary(model_bpd)
# Fit linear regression for 'bwt' using the log transformed 'ad' + 'bpd'
# Combine both models:
model_combined<-lm(log(bwt)~I(log(ad))+I(log(bpd)),data=secher)
summary(model_combined)
# For a prediction equation for birth weight.

# birthweight = -5.8615 + 1.4667(abdominal) + 1.5519(biparietal)

# B1. How much is gained by using both diameters in a prediction equation?
r_sq_model_ad<-summary(model_ad)$r.squared
r_sq_model_bpd<-summary(model_bpd)$r.squared
r_sq_model_combined<-summary(model_combined)$r.squared
r_sq_gain<-r_sq_model_combined - mean(c(r_sq_model_ad,r_sq_model_bpd))
cat("The Avg. Gain in R-sq is approx:", r_sq_gain, "\n")
# The sum of the two regression coefficients is almost identical and 
# equal to 3.

# B2. Can this be given a nice interpretation to our analysis?
# Please provide step by step on your analysis and code you use
# to find out the result. 

# The regression coefficients for log(ad) and log(bpd) are approx.(1.5) each.
# Their sum is approx. (3).
cat("Regression coefficients:","\n",
"Abdominal diameter:", coef(model_combined)[2],"\n",
"Biparietal diameter:", coef(model_combined)[3],"\n",
"Sum of coefficients:", coef(model_combined)[2] + coef(model_combined)[3],"\n")
# This suggests that a 1% increase in both abdominal and biparietal diameters 
# is associated with an approximate 3% increase in birth weight.

# Model without log-transformation:
model_reg<-lm(bwt~ad+bpd,data=secher)
# Predict 'bwt' for 1% increase in both 'ad' & 'bpd'
predict(model_reg,data.frame(ad=c(95,96),bpd=c(95,96)))
# Calculate percent increase
percentIncrease<-((2753.895-2676.999)/2676.999)*100
cat("For a 1% increase from 95mm to 96mm in both 'ad' & 'bpd'
The 'bwt' gain in grams is approx:", percentIncrease, "%")
# B3. Just an additional question (This will not be graded).
# When should we consider "log-transforming" a dataset?
# This is a very common practice in data science. 

cat("When simplifying complex relationships. For example,
some relationships between variables might be difficult to interpret 
in the original scale. Log-transforming could simplify the complex
relationships, making them easier to understand and model.")
