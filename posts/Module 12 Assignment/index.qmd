Exercise in Time Series Regression!

```{r}
# Question A.

# The table below represents charges for a student credit card. 
```

```{r warning=FALSE,message=FALSE}
# A1. Construct a time series plot using R.

# Enter data:

charge<-c(31.9,27,31.3,31,39.4,40.7,42.3,49.5,45,50,50.9,58.5,39.4,36.2,40.5,44.6,46.8,44.7,52.2,54,48.8 ,55.8,58.7,63.4)
chargeTimeSeries<-ts(charge,frequency=12,start=c(2012,1))
chargeTimeSeries
# Plot the time series regression:
plot.ts(chargeTimeSeries)


# A2. Employ the Exponential Smoothing Model as outlined in Avril Voghlan's
#     notes and report the statistical  outcome:
chargeTimeSeriesForecasts<-HoltWinters(chargeTimeSeries)
chargeTimeSeriesForecasts
# The output of HoltWinters() estimates the alpha @ 0.4786973
# Close to .50, suggesting that the forecasts are based on both
# the past and future observations almost equal weight.

# Plot with Exponential Smoothing:
plot(chargeTimeSeriesForecasts)
# The original time series in black, and the red line is the forecast.
# The time series regression of forecasts is smoother.


# The distance between the fitted value and the actual observed value.
# Using the measure of accuracy, or sum of squared errors:
chargeTimeSeriesForecasts$SSE


# A3. Provide a discussion on the time series and Exponential Smoothing
#     Model result you led to. 

# This time series could be described using an additive model,
# the seasonal and random fluctuations seem to be roughly constant
# in size over time with an overall positive trend including
# some annual seasonal increase/decrease trends as well:

# The students spend the least at the beginning of the year,
# a significant increase in the middle of the year,
# and spend the most towards the end of the year.
# There is a sharp decline in spending at the beginning of each new year.

# To learn more about the component trends of the data set, the 
# decompose() function can be used:
chargeTimeSeriesComponents<-decompose(chargeTimeSeries)
plot(chargeTimeSeriesComponents)
# The top chart shows the observed data.

# The trend shows an increase from 41.77083 in July 2012 to
# 48.55417 in June of 2013.

# The "seasonal" components:
chargeTimeSeriesComponents$seasonal
# These figures confirm the sharp -6.8986111 to -10.6986111 decline from
# Jan. into Feb., the 6.8472222 increase in Aug. and the 12.7805556
# increase in Dec.

# Using simple exponential smoothing to make short-term future forecasts.
library("forecast")
chargeFutureForecast <- forecast(chargeTimeSeriesForecasts,h=12)
plot(chargeFutureForecast)
# This plot displays the prediction for 2014.
