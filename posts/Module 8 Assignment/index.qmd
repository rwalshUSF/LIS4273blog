# Question A.

# A researcher is interested in the effects of drug against
# stress reactions. She gives a reaction time test to three
# different groups of subjects:
# one group that is under a great deal of stress,
# one group under a moderate amount of stress,
# and a third group that is under almost no stress.
# The subjects of the study were instructed to take the drug test
# during their next stress episode and to report their stress on a
# scale of 1 to 10 (10 being the most pain).

df<-data.frame("High.Stress"=c(10,9,8,9,10,8),
               "Moderate.Stress"=c(8,10,6,7,8,8),
               "Low.Stress"=c(4,6,6,4,2,2))
df

stress.pain.level<-c(df$High.Stress,df$Moderate.Stress,df$Low.Stress)

subject.group.amount<-factor(c(rep("High",6),
                        rep("Moderate",6),
                        rep("Low",6)),
                        levels = c("High","Moderate","Low"))

# Report on drug and stress level by using R.
# Provide a full summary report on the result
# of ANOVA testing and what it means.

# Look at the means for stress level by group:
tapply(stress.pain.level,subject.group.amount,mean)
# Look at the variations for stress level by group:
tapply(stress.pain.level,subject.group.amount,var)
# Look at a boxplot graph:
boxplot(stress.pain.level ~ subject.group.amount,
        main = "Effects of Drug Against Stress Reactions",
        xlab = "Stress amount groups",
        ylab = "Stress level pain (1-10)")
# More specifically, report the following:
# Df, Sum, Sq Mean, Sq, F value, Pr(>F)

# Did the drug have any affect on specific groups stress levels?

# Test the difference between the means of the groups with ANOVA.

# Null Ho: The mean stress levels are similar between groups
# Alt  Ha: The mean stress levels are significantly different between groups
aov.out<-aov(stress.pain.level ~ subject.group.amount,data = df)
summary(aov.out)
# The Df for subject.group.amount is '2' because there are three
# groups sampled, so k-1 = 2, where k = number of groups sampled.
# for the residuals row, the Df is '15' because there are 6 observations
# in 3 samples, so N-k = 18-3 = 15.

# Sum Sq is for 'Sum of the Squares' which is measuring the variance,
# the higher this number is = more variance in the data, or groups.
# Sum Sq for subject.group.amount, SS(B) = 82.11, indicating a large
# variance between the groups, and Sum Sq for the residuals, SS(W) = 28.83
# indicating a large variance within the groups as well.
# Adding both of these would give the Total Variance.
# SS(B)+SS(W)=SS(T)

# Mean Sq normalizes the Sums of Squares by calculating mean squares.
# Size of obtained mean differences (including treatment effects) = MS(B)
# The Mean Sq for 'subject.group.amount' is: MS(B)=SS(B)/(K-1) = 41.06,
# There is a large difference between the means in the sample groups.
# Size of expected differences by chance (without treatment effects) = MS(W)
# The Mean Sq for the residuals is: MS(W)=SS(W)/(N-k) = 1.92
# The residuals row shows a smaller difference within the sample groups.

# The F value is the result of MS(B)/MS(W) = 21.36
# This test accounts for the random variation causing difference
# in the mean squares and is the analysis of variance between means.
# A value close to '1' indicates that the treatment has little to no effect
# on the group means, which does not signify a difference between groups,
# and there is not enough evidence to reject the Null Hypothesis that the
# means are very similar or identical.
# A large F value indicates a significant treatment effect, and would 
# cause the Null Hypothesis of similar means to be rejected because there
# is enough evidence for the Alternative Hypothesis to be considered.

# The Pr(>F) from ANOVA works like similar p-value significance tests.
# 95% confidence needs a p-value less than 0.05 to reject the Null.
# In this test the p-value = 4.08e-05, is significantly smaller than 0.001,
# indicating that the statistics are very significant.

# The large F value at 21.36 and the low 4.08e-05 p-value suggests
# evidence against the null hypothesis. Therefore, it can be assumed
# that the mean stress levels differ significantly among the three groups.

# Question B.

# From our Textbook: Introductory Statistics with R.
# Chapter # 6 Exercises 6.1 pp. 127 plus.
# The zelazo data (taken from the textbook's R package called ISwR)
# are in the form of a list of vectors, one for each of the four groups.

# B1. Convert the data to a form suitable for the user of lm,
# and calculate the relevant test.
library(ISwR)
data("zelazo")
summary(zelazo)
# To convert the data for linear model, lm()
# A 'value' column will hold the combined response variables
# A 'group' factor will create the categorical variable that
# will be used to combine the predictor variables
zelazo.df<-data.frame(
value=unlist(zelazo,use.names = F),
group=factor(rep(c("active","passive","none","ctr.8w"),sapply(zelazo,length)),
levels = c("active","passive","none","ctr.8w")))
zelazo.df
# Boxplot to view age at walking values by four group levels
boxplot(zelazo.df$value~zelazo.df$group,
        main = "Effects of Training on Infant Walking Ages",
        xlab = "Training Level Groups",
        ylab = "Walking Age in Months")
# Model and call the linear model, lm()
# This will model the relationship between the magnitude of one
# variable and that of a second
zelazo.lm<-lm(zelazo.df$value~zelazo.df$group)
summary(zelazo.lm)
# The residual standard error of 1.516 could be considered small
# indicating that the regression model fits the data set well.
# The median value in the distribution of the residuals is close to zero
# at -0.3500 and the min & max are roughly equal in absolute value.
# An F-value of 2.14 with a p-value of 0.1285 indicates that there is not
# enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the model with no
# independent variables fits the data as well as the model including treatment
# effects.The observed differences between groups are likely due to chance,
# as the p-value is relatively high and not statistically significant at the
# standard 0.05 significance level. To find the relationship between groups
# that is causing the difference, further investigation is necessary.

# Consider t-tests comparing selected subgroups
# or obtained by combining groups.

# The only group in the regression summary that showed significant
# statistical results was the 'ctr.8w' control group with a t-value
# of 2.423 and a Pr(>|t|) value of 0.0255 * indicating significant evidence
# to reject the null that the true coefficient of the control group and the
# intercept is equal to zero, and a relationship between the variables exists.

# So I will begin by using t-tests to compare the subgroups of the 
# control group and the other groups to test for significant differences
# between the means of the groups.
tapply(zelazo.df$value,zelazo.df$group,var)
# The variances are not the same between the groups so the Welch's
# variant of the t-test is sufficient.

# Two sample t-test comparing the means of 'none' group to 'control' group
t.test.result1<-t.test(zelazo.df$value~zelazo.df$group,
data=zelazo.df,
subset=group%in%c("none","ctr.8w"))
t.test.result1
# The p-value of 0.4187 is > 0.05 alpha, so there is not significant evidence
# to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means

# Two sample t-test comparing the means of 'passive' group to 'control' group
t.test.result2<-t.test(zelazo.df$value~zelazo.df$group,
data=zelazo.df,
subset=group%in%c("passive","ctr.8w"))
t.test.result2
# The p-value of 0.3042 is > 0.05 alpha, so there is not significant evidence
# to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means

# Two sample t-test comparing the means of active group to control group
t.test.result3<-t.test(zelazo.df$value~zelazo.df$group,
data=zelazo.df,
subset=group%in%c("active","ctr.8w"))
t.test.result3
# The p-value of 0.01453 is < 0.05 alpha, so there is significant evidence
# to reject the null hypothesis that there is no difference between the means!
# We can conclude that a difference between these two groups' means exists!



# B2. Consider the ANOVA test (one-way or two-way) for this dataset (zelazo)

# The one-way ANOVA test will test the null hypothesis that there is no
# difference between the means of the group that received the treatment and 
# the means of the groups that did not receive the treatment.

# h0: All group means are equal
# ha: All group means are not equal

# The one-way test to compare differences between the group means
oneway.test(zelazo.df$value~zelazo.df$group)
# With an F value = 2.7759, and p-value = 0.09373, we fail to reject the null
# hypothesis that all group means are equal. This is strange because we know
# they are different somehow, further analysis of the groups is needed.

# The aov() function fits analysis of variance (ANOVA)
# models directly to the data
zelazo.aov<-aov(zelazo.df$value~zelazo.df$group,data=zelazo.df)
zelazo.aov
summary(zelazo.aov)
# It returns an ANOVA table with sources of variation and associated statistics

# The anova() function performs analysis of variance (ANOVA)
# on model objects
anova(zelazo.lm)
# It returns an ANOVA table comparing models or factors,
# showing sources of variation and statistics

# Which yields the same results as the lm() 
summary(zelazo.lm)
plot(zelazo.lm)
# Because the p-value is > 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis
# that each group mean is equal, However, Post-Hoc Tests can be
# used to explore how the groups differ from each other to learn more
# about where the variance in the means exists.

# The Tukey Test offers a glimpse at the relationships between all of the
# pairs and combinations of the groups
TukeyHSD(zelazo.aov)
# The adjusted p-value will indicate if there is a significant
# statistical relationship between two groups.

# The ctr.8w-active is closest to being less than 0.05 at 0.1063883,
# but is still not considered significant enough to be outside of the 95%
# confidence level
